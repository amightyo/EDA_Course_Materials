# Big Data Exploration with HPCC
========================================================

This is an R Markdown document or RMD. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **Help** toolbar button for more details on using R Markdown).

```{r}
x <- c(1:10)
y <- x*2
```






When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.
